# Foresight

### *(deprecated)*

Old healthcare-solutions prototype I built using React.js for an NLP / ML startup.

This app took user-uploaded electronic health records, verified the format of those records, checked for specific medical tests, pulled relevant test results, and calculated the patients 5-year and longer-term risks for developing certain diseases.

TL;DR: health records -> risk % of developing a particular disease
